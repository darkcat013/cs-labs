## Theory

Cryptography is a branch of mathematics that deals with securing information,
also ensuring authentication and restricting access in an informational system.

Classic cryptography falls under the class of symmetric key cryptography and is cryptography
before the computer, hence the name pre-computational cryptography. In classic cryptography, algorithms were character-based and consisted of a series of elementary transformations
(substitutions and transpositions) of plaintext characters.

### Substitution ciphers

The substitution cipher is the cipher in which each character or group of
characters of the plaintext m is replaced by another character or group of characters in the ciphertext c,
decryption is done by applying reverse substitution on the encrypted text.

### Monoalphabetic substitution ciphers

Monoalphabetic substitution ciphers (monoalphabetic ciphers) are the ciphers in which each
plaintext character m is replaced by a corresponding ciphertext character c.
Representatives of this class are: the Caesar cipher, the Polybios cipher, etc.

### The Caesar Cipher

In this cipher, each letter of the plaintext is replaced by a new letter obtained by an alphabetical shift. The secret key k, which is the same for encryption as and
upon decryption, it consists of the number indicating the alphabetic displacement, i.e. $k \in \{1, 2, 3,…, n–1\}$, where n is the length of the alphabet. The encryption and decryption of the message with the Caesar cipher can be defined by the formulas
where x and y are the numeric representation of the respective plaintext character.

For example, for the plaintext $m=Caesar\ cipher$ and key $k = 7$ we get the ciphertext $c=Jhlzhy\ jpwoly$

Caesar's cipher is very easy to crack, so it is a very weak cipher. Thus, a cryptanalyst can get the plain text by trying all 25 keys.

### The Polybius Cipher

In the Polybius cipher, a separate encryption square is built for each alphabet, most often with the same number of columns and lines (but this is not a necessary condition). Square dimensions depend on the length n of the alphabet. To create the square, two integers are taken, the product of which is closest to n. The lines and columns are numbered. After this the letters of the alphabet are written in this box in their natural order. If there are not enough cells for the letters of the alphabet, 2 letters can be entered in a cell or a few letters can be omitted (usually with the lowest possible frequency). For the Latin alphabet, we can have Polibios 5×5 squares by placing I and J in the same square.

|   | m | o | u | s   | e |
|---|---|---|---|-----|---|
| m | A | B | C | D   | E |
| u | F | G | H | I/J | K |
| s | L | M | N | O   | P |
| c | Q | R | S | T   | U |
| a | V | W | X | Y   | Z |

For example, with the table above, the plaintext VENI VIDI VICI is encrypted in

ma em us su ma su sm su ma su um su

The weak point of monoalphabetic encryption systems lies in the frequency of occurrence of characters in the text. If an encrypted text is long enough and the language in which the plaintext is written is known, the system can be broken through an attack based on the frequency of occurrence of letters.

### Polyalphabetic substitution ciphers

The difference between polyalphabetic and monoalphabetic ciphers consists in the fact that the substitution of a character varies in the text, depending on various parameters (position, context, etc.). This of course leads to a much larger number of possible keys. The first polyalphabetic encryption system is believed to have been created by Leon Battista in 1568. Some current applications still use such encryption systems.

### The Vigenere cipher

Like the Caesar cipher, the Vigenere cipher moves the letters, but unlike it, it cannot be easily broken into 26 combinations. The Vigenere cipher uses a multiple shift. The key is not made up of a single shift, but of several, being generated by several integers $k_{i}$, where $0 \le k_{i} \le 25$, if we take the Latin alphabet with 26 letters as a reference. Encryption is done as follows:

$c_i = m_i + k_i (mod\ 26)$

The key is usually a word, to be easier to remember and $k_i$ represents the position of the key letter in the alphabet.

Decryption for the Vigenere cipher is similar to encryption. The difference is that the key is subtracted from the ciphertext:

$m_i = c_i – k_i (mod\ 26)$

For example, for the plaintext $m=Per\ aspera\ ad\ astra$ and key $k = Super$ we get the ciphertext $c=Hyg\ ejhyhe\ rv\ uhxis$

The Vigenere cipher is a lot safer than the Caesar cipher for two reasons:

- the first reason is that the others do not know the length of the key;
- the second reason is that the number of possible solutions increases, for example, for the key length equal to 5, the number of combinations that would be necessary for the exhaustive search would be $26^5 = 11,881,376$.

### Homophonic ciphers

The homophonic ciphers are intermediate ciphers between mono and polyalphabetic systems. Its main purpose is to avoid the attack by the frequency of appearance of the characters.

## Objectives

1. Get familiar with the basics of cryptography and classical ciphers.

2. Implement 4 types of the classical ciphers:
    - Caesar cipher,
    - Polybius cipher,
    - Vigenere cipher,
    - Playfair cipher.

3. Structure the project in methods/classes/packages as neeeded.

## Implementation description

- About 2-3 sentences to explain each piece of the implementation.

- Code snippets from your files.

```
public static void main() 
{

}
```

- If needed, screenshots.
